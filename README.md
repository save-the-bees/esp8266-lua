# Lua code for the ESP8266 running as a CoAP node (client+server)

## Introduction

This is the Lua code to run the ESP8266 as a CoAP node, i.e., as both
a client and a server.

## Implementation notes

We have lofty goals regarding the Lua implementation. Some of the
ideas are described
[here](https://github.com/save-the-bees/plans/blob/master/esp8266_sensor_nodes.md).

The current code is just a placeholder for that. It runs a very basic
CoAP server that provides temperature sensing data from a
[DS18B20](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/sensors-and-sensor-interface/DS18B20.html). 

Check the
[instructions](https://github.com/relayr/ESP8266_Lua/blob/master/README.md#building-sensor-nodes-using-coap)
on how to get started.

## TODO

The real implementation along the lines of the above mentioned plans.
